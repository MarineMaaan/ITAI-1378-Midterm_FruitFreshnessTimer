## Problem Statement

[A significant portion of fresh fruit purchased by US households spoils before it can be consumed, making produce one of the largest categories of household food waste. This spoilage not only represents a direct financial loss for families, totaling billions of dollars annually, but it also contributes to the environmental burden of food in landfills. Consumers often struggle to accurately gauge freshness and predict the shelf-life of their fruit, leading to this cycle of waste.]
